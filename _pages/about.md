I am a **third-year** Undergraduate Student (Ranking **7/202**) of **Computer Science and Technology (Top-notch Undergraduate Training Program)**, **Chongqing University**, China.

My research interests primarily center on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a specific focus on:
* **Diffusion LLMs**
* **Multimodal LLMs**

I am deeply fascinated by the mechanisms of **reasoning** in large language models and exploring how to align them with **human cognition and logic** (Alignment & Reasoning).

🔥 **I am actively seeking research internship opportunities. Please feel free to contact me!**
